Calculate area of rectangle, circle, and average of numbers.

Able to perform numeric operations with variables.

	1. Understand variables, assignment - Completed
	
	name = "Ambili"
	division = 12
	print(f"My Name is {name} and I am studying in {division}th standard")
	
	2. integers, and floating point numbers - Completed
	
	x = 10              #Integer
	print(x)
	print(type(x))

	y = 10.5            #Float
	print(y)
	print(type(y))

	z = "Ambili"        #String
	print(z)
	print(type(z))
	
	3. Calculate area of a rectangle - Completed
	
	# Finding the Area of a Rectangle
	# Area = length * breadth

	length = 15
	breadth = 20 

	area = length * breadth 

	print("The area of the rectangle is", area) 
	
	4.Calculate area of a circle - Completed
	
	# Calculate the Area of a Circle
	# Area = pi * square of radius
	# pi = 3.14 or 22/7

	pi = 22/7
	radius = 16 

	area = pi * radius**2

	print("The area of the circle is", round(area, 2))
	
	5. average of numbers - Completed
	
	# Average of Numbers
	# Average = Sum / Length

	nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

	total = sum(nums)
	length = len(nums)

	average = total/length

	print("The average is", average)
