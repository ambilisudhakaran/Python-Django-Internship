	first_name = input("Enter Your First Name: ")
	last_name = input("Enter Your Last Name: ")

	print(f"Hello, {first_name} {last_name}")

	
	2. learn indexing, slicing - Completed
	
	x = "Hello World!"
	print(x[0:5])
	print(x[6:11])
	print(x[::])
	print(x[::-1])
	
	3.string methods - Completed
	
	x = "Hello World!"

	#count function
	print(x.count("o"))

	#length function
	print(len(x))

	last_name = "Sudhakaran"

	full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

	5. reverse string - Completed
	
	x = "Hello World!"
	print(x[::-1])
	
	6. count characters - Completed
	
	x = "Hello World!"

	#count function
	print(x.count("o"))
	
	7. Manipulate string data effectively - Completed
	
	x = " Hello, World! "

	print(x)

	x = x.strip()

	print(x)

	print(x.replace("World", "Python"))
