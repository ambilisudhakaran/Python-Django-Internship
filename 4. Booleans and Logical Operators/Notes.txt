4. Booleans and Logical Operators

	Learn about boolean values and logical operations (and, or, not).

	Evaluate expressions like x > y and combine with logical operators.

	Understand boolean expressions.

	x = True
	y = False
	
	print(type(x))
	print(bool(0)) #False
	print(bool(range(0))) #False
	print(bool(0.1)) #True
	print(bool(1)) #True
	print(bool("Hello World!")) #True
	print(bool("")) #False

	x = 5

	print(x > 3 and x < 10) 
	print(x > 3 and x > 10)

	print(x > 3 or x < 10)
	print(x > 10 or x < 3)

	print(not(x > 3))
	print(not(x > 10))

	x = 3
	y = 6

	# x is less than y
	print(x < y)

	# x is greater than y 
	print(x > y)

	# x is equal to y
	print(x == y)

	# x is less than or equal to y
	print(x <= y)

	# x is greater than or equal to y
	print(x >= y)

	# x is not equal to y
	print(x != y)
