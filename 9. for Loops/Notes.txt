9. for Loops

Repeat a block for a known number of times or items.

Iterate over a list of students and print names.

Use loop to iterate over a sequence.

	1. Repeat a block for a known number of times or items	- Completed
	
	fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
	for fruit in fruits:
		print(fruit)
	
	2. Iterate over a list of students and print names - Completed
	
	students = ["Lisa", "Rosie", "Pinky", "Alia"]

	#Method 1
	for name in students: 
		print(name)

	print()

	#Method 2
	for i in range(0, len(students)):
		print(f"{i+1}. {students[i]}")

	print()

	#Method 3
	for name in students: 
		print(f"{students.index(name) + 1}. {name}")
	
	3. Use loop to iterate over a sequence - Completed
	
	sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

	# for number in sequence:
	#     print(number)

	for i in range(0, len(sequence)):
		print(f"Sum of first {sequence[i]} numbers are : {sum(sequence[0:i+1])}")
